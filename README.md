# iPlanets
A simple application with animations of the planets.

There are 3 switches. Each is responsible for its function: When you click on "Rotation" - the Planet starts rotate, click "Translation" - the Planet moves around the screen, click "Scale" the Planet changes the size. (Also, when you turn off certain switches, the corresponding animations are turned off). When you slider the "Speed" slider, each animation changes the speed depending on the selected value.
